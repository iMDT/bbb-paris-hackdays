## Project
Embedding Docs into BigBlueButton (BBB + Docs = FTW).

## Project Description
Today, BigBlueButton is the [state webinar system](https://webinaire.numerique.gouv.fr/home).

**The Problem** is a webinar finishes, participants want key information:

 - Details from Attendance, Votes, Notes
 - Full Transcript
 - Summary + Next Steps (AI)

**The Solution** we created was to build upon the new BigBlueButton 3.0 and
 1. Create a new Docs document for each webinar
 2. Embed docs into BigBlueButton using a plug-in (no modifications to core BigBlueButton!)
 3. After meeting finishes, use AI to build and append key information to associated docs 
 4. Make a new recording format that will appear in b3desk.
